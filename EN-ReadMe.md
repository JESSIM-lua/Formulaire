# Form

### This was a school assignment (Homework)

A form that was completed in just one evening, the idea was to set a real challenge to test myself. It uses the new version of VueJS which I had to learn on the fly for more fun, and for the backend, a technology I am comfortable with, Node.js and Express. Unfortunately, this challenge was a failure, I underestimated the change between Vue2 and Vue3. Moreover, converting the PDF took longer than expected, and reformatting everything was a bit lengthy; I should have coded more cleanly without errors and more quickly.
